# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of the Flux compiler seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please do NOT open a public issue. Instead, please report it to us privately.

### Reporting Channels

Please send an email to the project maintainers (Otabek Sadiridinov) or use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature if enabled.

### What to Include

When reporting a vulnerability, please provide:
- A detailed description of the flaw.
- A proof-of-concept (PoC) or steps to reproduce the issue.
- Potential impact and how it could be exploited.

### Our Commitment

We will:
- Acknowledge your report within 48 hours.
- Provide an estimated timeline for a fix.
- Notify you once the vulnerability is patched.
- Give you credit for the discovery (unless you prefer to remain anonymous).

## Supported Versions

We currently only support the latest version of Flux (0.x). Security patches will be applied to the main branch.
